# Differential Abundance
What this tutorial demonstrates:
* Installation of `qiime2R`, `DESeq2`, and `metagenomeSeq` packages in R
* Importing, subsetting, filtering, and sorting a feature table in R
* Testing for differential abundance of features using two popular methods:
  * The`nbinomWaldTest` method in `DESeq2`
  * The `fitZig` method in `metagenomeSeq`
